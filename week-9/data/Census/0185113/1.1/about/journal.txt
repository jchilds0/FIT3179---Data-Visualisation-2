Source: Stephanie Sexton, NOAA/NMFS/SWFSC/AERD, submitted data and metadata
to NCEI in submission package XR9CXM via Send2NCEI (S2N).

into this accession. A metadata record in ISO 19115-2 XML format was also
generated from the information provided by the submitter and was copied into
this accession.

Files:

about/ 
This directory contains files created by NCEI staff and processing, including
'negotiable' information between NCEI staff and the data provider.

0185113_lonlat.txt - 
  Contains sample collection area bounding coordinates for these data.  
  Each row contains the geographical position where these data were collected 
  (longitude in the left column and latitude in the right column, both in degrees).  
  NCEI may have corrected geographic positions that seemed to be in error when
  generating this file. However, NCEI did not change the original data files 
  under the directory data/0-data/.

  The four dots represent the bounding area coordinates for these data. 
  Data were collected within the box that they represent. Individual sample
